Jason Playtest -


He got better overtime. 100+ deaths
Goal felt/came off as a wall initially
Was not clear that controller was the way to go input wise
First level should be deathless and make it obvious that you are tiliting
Mechanics break down at high speed
Font doesnt match aesthetic
Slanted Stairs Felt hard
Had alot of fun on plane level and was favorite
Camera Follow
